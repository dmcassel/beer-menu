This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Beer Menu is a full-stack web application for managing a craft beverage catalog — beers and wines. It supports browsing the public menu, managing inventory (beers with status on_tap/bottle_can/out, wines with cellar/refrigerator counts), and organizing items by style, brewery, menu category, and location. Authentication is Google OAuth, with role-based access (user, curator, admin).

| Vitest | Testing |
| Docker / docker-compose | Local dev database and production deployment |
| Google Auth Library | OAuth sign-in |

## Commands

For local development, only Postgres runs in Docker (`postgres` and `postgres-test` services). The middle tier (Express + Vite) runs directly on the host via `npm run dev` — do not use the `app` service in `docker-compose.yml` for development; that service builds the production image and is for deployment only (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

```bash
# Development (starts Express + Vite HMR together)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Type check
npm run check

# Format code
npm run format

# Run tests (requires test DB running)
npm test

# Start test database (uses the postgres-test service in docker-compose.yml)
npm run test:db:start
# Equivalent direct command:
# docker-compose --env-file .env.test up -d postgres-test

# Run tests with DB lifecycle managed automatically
npm run test:with-db

# Apply DB migrations (local)
npm run db:migrate

# Generate + apply migrations
npm run db:push
```

Data flows: React page → tRPC hook (via `@/lib/trpc`) → tRPC router (`server/routers.ts`) → DB function (`server/db.ts` or `server/db_wine.ts`) → PostgreSQL via Drizzle.

## Code Patterns

### tRPC procedures

Three permission levels are defined in `server/_core/trpc.ts`:
- `publicProcedure` — no auth required
- `protectedProcedure` — any authenticated user
- `curatorProcedure` — curator or admin role only
- `adminProcedure` — admin only

Read operations use `publicProcedure`; all writes use `curatorProcedure`.

### DB functions

All DB functions in `server/db.ts` and `server/db_wine.ts` follow the same pattern: call `getDb()`, guard against null (return empty/undefined for reads, throw for writes), then run the Drizzle query.

### Types

Schema types are defined in `drizzle/schema.ts` using `$inferSelect` / `$inferInsert` and re-exported from `shared/types.ts`. Import shared types via `@shared/types` on the client.

### Path aliases

| Alias | Resolves to |
|-------|------------|
| `@/` | `client/src/` |
| `@shared/` | `shared/` |
| `@assets/` | `attached_assets/` |

### Naming

- Files: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for utilities and DB modules
- DB entity IDs use the pattern `{entityName}Id` (e.g., `beerId`, `menuCatId`)
- tRPC router keys mirror DB entity names (`beer`, `brewery`, `style`, `wine`, etc.)

---

## Testing

- **Run tests**: `npm test` (requires the test DB to be running first)
- **Test location**: `server/**/*.test.ts`
- **DB for tests**: separate PostgreSQL instance via docker-compose on port 5433, configured by `.env.test`
- Tests run sequentially (`fileParallelism: false`) because multiple test files share the database

---

## Validation

```bash
npm run check   # TypeScript type check
npm run format  # Prettier formatting
npm test        # Run tests (needs test DB)
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `drizzle/schema.ts` | Canonical DB schema — all tables, enums, relations, and inferred types |
| `server/routers.ts` | All tRPC endpoints; the single source of truth for the API surface |
| `server/db.ts` | Beer/menu/user query functions |
| `server/db_wine.ts` | Wine query functions |
| `server/_core/trpc.ts` | tRPC init + procedure middleware (auth guards) |
| `server/_core/context.ts` | tRPC request context (user session resolution) |
| `client/src/lib/trpc.ts` | tRPC client setup |
| `client/src/App.tsx` | Route definitions |
| `shared/const.ts` | Shared constants (cookie name, error messages) |
| `.env.example` | Documents all required environment variables |

---

## On-Demand Context

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Deployment | `DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| Google OAuth setup | `GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md` |
| PostgreSQL setup | `POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md` |
| Test DB setup | `TEST_SETUP.md` |
| Docker setup | `Docker Setup for Beer Menu Application.md` |

## Notes

- Branch names must start with the GitHub issue number: `{issue-number}/{name}`
- Use `npm` (not pnpm or bun)
- The test DB runs on port 5433; production DB on 5432
- Beer status values: `on_tap`, `bottle_can`, `out`; only `on_tap` and `bottle_can` beers appear on the public menu
- User roles: `user` (read-only), `curator` (can create/edit/delete catalog items), `admin` (full access)

## GitHub Project Workflow

GitHub project: https://github.com/users/dmcassel/projects/1/views/1

### Worktrees

Use the user's existing worktree via `EnterWorktree`. Do not create a new worktree with `isolation: "worktree"`.

### Creating Stories (`/create-stories`)

After creating GitHub issues:
1. Add each issue to the GitHub project with status **"Todo"**
2. If more than one issue is created, also create an **Epic** issue:
   - Title prefix: `EPIC: `
   - Body includes links to all sub-issues
   - Add the Epic to the project with status **"Todo"**

### Planning (`/plan`)

After creating the plan file, move the GitHub issue to **"In Progress"** in the project.
If the issue belongs to an Epic, also move the Epic to **"In Progress"** (when the first sub-issue moves).

### After Implementing (`/implement`)

After implementation is complete:
1. Create a PR with `gh pr create`
2. Do **not** close the issue — leave it open until the PR is merged/closed

### Epic Completion

When the last sub-issue in an Epic is closed, close the Epic issue.

### Labels

Always add the `Claude` label to any issue or PR you create.

### GitHub Project CLI

Add an issue to the project:
```bash
gh project item-add 1 --owner dmcassel --url <issue-url>
```

Update an item's status (requires project ID, item ID, field ID, and option ID — look these up with `gh project field-list 1 --owner dmcassel` and `gh project item-list 1 --owner dmcassel --format json`).
